    <div>
      <p>The assignment that I created is called css level one assessment</p>
                                                               </div>
    
    <p>CSS level on assessment is like a website blog where you could also send feedback ask questions and leave comments. On there it has a link to google which could actually take you to google because I made it so that a couple of words could be a link. In this assingment I also did a lot with different borders like with solid and dashed and also different sizes with it that's why sometimes it was easy and some were complicated. I also worked with using div which for me was the most confusing part but I eventually was able to figure it out and have the div part highlighted in the sentence.</p>
